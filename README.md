# Assembly
A basic assembly lab I completed for class. 

For Task 1, I had to do basic arithmetic and then output the final value on our terminal. The equation I had to evaluate was 

```
(a-b) + (c-d) 
```

which would be simple enough in a more advance language. In Assembly, the task was tougher; however, it was not that bad in 
the end. Task 2 was more complex soley because I had to work with arrays.

For Task 2, I had to define 3 seperate arrays at the start of the program. The first two arrays had to gather 4 total user inputs. The first two were stored in the first array and the sum was then stored in the first index of our final 
array. The process was the same for the last two user inputs except the sum was stored in the second index of the third array. I then outputted the total sum of the final array on the termainl. 

Let me try to make this simplier to understand if my wording was poor.

```
Array1 = [20, 40] //60
Array2 = [35, 30] //65
Sum = [60, 65] //Output 125
```

All of the numbers above can be changed because the user inputs all the numbers that are stored in Array1 and Array2!
